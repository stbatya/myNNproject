# myNNproject
little self-teaching project to develop my skills in machine learning and flask

The idea is to create a convolutional neural network for handwritten digits(mnist) recognition and to create a flask-based webapp implementing this cnn. The app is practically single(may be a couple more, to practice in creating links) web page with canvas html element. Drawing on canvas is sent through ajax to the flask-server and feeded to the pretrained network. Then the prediction is sent back to the user as a response.
